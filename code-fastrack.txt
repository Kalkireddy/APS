Perfect, Shiv. Here's your fast-track hands-on roadmap — covering everything a DevOps engineer must master, from beginner to expert — including:

✅ Jenkins Pipelines

✅ Terraform Templates

✅ Ansible Playbooks

✅ Kubernetes YAMLs

✅ Dockerfiles

✅ AWS Lambda Functions

✅ Azure ARM Templates

✅ Bash Scripts

✅ Python Automation Scripts

✅ Cloud Platforms: AWS + Azure

I’ve broken this down into phased weeks with specific goals, tools, and outputs. This is a hands-on-first roadmap, optimized for speed without cutting corners.

🚀 DevOps Coding Roadmap (Beginner → Expert)
🗓️ Week 1: Foundation Boot-up (Prep Layer)
Area	Goals
🖥️ Linux/Bash	Basics + scripting, file ops, cron jobs
🧠 Git/GitHub	Clone, branch, PR, rebase, workflows
🐳 Docker	Dockerfile, docker-compose, image optimization
✍️ Hands-on	Write: 10+ bash scripts (disk, backup, cron, logs), 5 Dockerfiles (Python, Node, Nginx, etc.)
🗓️ Week 2: Jenkins + Pipelines (CI/CD Core)
Area	Goals
📦 Jenkins	Setup, plugins, Jenkinsfile syntax
🔁 Pipelines	Declarative & scripted, multibranch
🔗 Integration	GitHub, Docker, Terraform
✍️ Hands-on	Write: 5+ Jenkinsfiles (build, test, deploy to EC2/EKS, Docker push, multistage pipelines)
🗓️ Week 3: Terraform (Infra as Code)
Area	Goals
📐 Basics	Providers, resources, variables, outputs
🔁 Intermediate	Modules, remote backend, workspaces
☁️ Cloud	AWS: EC2, S3, IAM, VPC
✍️ Hands-on	Write: 8+ reusable modules, 5 env-specific Terraform stacks, backend.tf setup
🗓️ Week 4: Ansible + Config Management
Area	Goals
⚙️ Playbooks	YAML structure, roles, handlers, vars
📦 Inventories	Dynamic + static (AWS/Azure)
💥 Advanced	Conditionals, loops, Jinja2 templates
✍️ Hands-on	Write: 10+ playbooks (Nginx, users, Docker, Git, AWS CLI, multi-host deploy)
🗓️ Week 5: Kubernetes YAMLs + Helm
Area	Goals
🔧 Core YAMLs	Pod, Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret
🌐 Networking	Ingress, LoadBalancer, headless svc
🧰 Advanced	StatefulSet, DaemonSet, probes, volumes
📦 Helm	Chart basics, templates, values
✍️ Hands-on	Write: 10+ manifests, 3 Helm charts, 1 multi-tier app deploy on EKS/AKS
🗓️ Week 6: Cloud Functions + Templates
Area	Goals
⚡ AWS Lambda	Python handler, IAM role, API Gateway
🔵 Azure ARM	JSON schema, parameters, linked templates
🔁 Bicep (bonus)	Bicep syntax for cleaner ARM templates
✍️ Hands-on	Write: 5 Lambda functions (S3 trigger, API), 3+ ARM templates (VM, Storage, NSG)
🗓️ Week 7: Python + Bash Automation Scripts
Area	Goals
🐍 Python CLI	argparse, subprocess, boto3, automation
🐚 Bash	CLI tools, logs, monitoring, system cleanup
✍️ Hands-on	Write: 5 Python scripts (AWS resource mgmt), 10 Bash scripts (alerts, cleanup, triggers)
🗓️ Week 8: CI/CD Projects (Real-World Build)
Project Area	Stack
🛠️ Microservices CI/CD	Docker + Jenkins + EKS (AWS)
🧱 Infra Automation	Terraform + Jenkins + Azure DevOps
🧪 Monitoring & Logging	Prometheus + Grafana + ELK
✍️ Outcome	GitHub-ready, interview-ready projects
